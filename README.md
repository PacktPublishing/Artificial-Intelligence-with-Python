This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464392), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
During the course of this book, you will find out how to make informed decisions about what algorithms to use in a given context. Starting from the basics of Artificial Intelligence, you will learn how to develop various building blocks using different data mining techniques. You will see how to implement different algorithms to get the best possible results, and will understand how to apply them to real-world scenarios. If you want to add an intelligence layer to any application thatâ€™s based on images, text, stock market, or some other form of data, this exciting book on Artificial Intelligence will definitely be your guide!

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
A block of code is set as follows:

[default]
exten => s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
exten => s,2,Voicemail(u100)
exten => s,102,Voicemail(b100)
exten => i,1,Voicemail(s0)
```

This book is focused on artificial intelligence in Python as opposed to the Python itself. We have used Python 3 to build various applications. We focus on how to utilize various Python libraries in the best possible way to build real world applications. In that spirit, we have tried to keep all of the code as friendly and readable as possible. We feel that this will enable our readers to easily understand the code and readily use it in different scenarios.
